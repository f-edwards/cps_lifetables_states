Replication of life table estimates requires access to NCANDS and AFCARS data, available by request from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect. Life table estimates in the paper are derived from NCANDS/AFCARS 2014 - 2020 data, following missing data and multiple imputation procedures described in the paper. Please contact the research team (frank.edwards@rutgers) for replication code for missing data processing if of interest.
